# Power-bi---Machine-failure-analysis---dashboard
Machine operation improvements on failure analysis
This is an initial upload of my  Predictive Maintenance project.  
Currently, it includes:
-up lode raw (.csv) dataset in python\ 
              - clean data,remove duplicates,transform data.
              - calcute reat of failure by each machine type.
              - drow visuale chart to find the patern in dataset.
              - get Data Quality Assurance (QA) from customer in each step.
-this up lode clean dataset and transform dataset to power bi\
               -add KPI Trend Chart (Rate of failure by slicer).
               -add bar charts to find retation between Machine failure by power,torque per RPM, etc.
               -find key points from visualizations.
-publish in power bi server /
                     - to share the dash board to team for further analysis/ 
                                                               -(https://app.powerbi.com/links/g35AFzrFnR?ctid=60794dde-6928-43f3-92f5-923c26eca7cd&pbi_source=linkShare)

-note:  using logical regression to predict future  Maintenance
